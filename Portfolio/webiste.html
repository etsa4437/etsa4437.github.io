    <h2 style="color:rgb(59, 31, 153)">About</h2>
    <p>I am a 3rd year student at CU Boulder, and I am majoring in Environmental Studies with a minor in creatibe technology design. I grew up in Laguna Beach, California and spent a lot of time going to the beach and skateboarding there. I went to high school in Jackson Hole, Wyoming and that helped my skiing skills, and also helped me further connect with nature. </p>
    <h2 style="color:rgb(59, 31, 153)">Interests</h2>
    <p>I love being active and getting outside — whether it’s skateboarding, skiing, sailing, or going for a hike, I am game. On the contrary, I also love playing video games, painting, and drawing. Having a creative outlet I enjoy is very important to me, and it is constantly changing. </p>
    <h2 style="color:rgb(59, 31, 153)">Goals</h2>
    <p>My goals are to learn as much as I possibly can during my time at CU Boulder while also making good connections with people. I have also been working out for a few years, and while I am not quite where I want to be yet, I love working out, and getting into perfect physical condition is a big goal of mine. </p>
