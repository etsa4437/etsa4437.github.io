<h2>About</h2>
    <img src="headshot.png" alt="Photo of me" width="200" class="profile-pic">
    <p>I am a 3rd year student at CU Boulder, and I am majoring in Environmental Studies
     with a minor in creative technology design. I grew up in Laguna Beach, California
     and spent a lot of time going to the beach and skateboarding there. I went to high
     school in Jackson Hole, Wyoming and that helped my skiing skills, and also helped me
     further connect with nature. </p>
