    <p>I am a 3rd year student at CU Boulder, and I am majoring in Environmental Studies with a minor in creative technology design. I grew up in Laguna Beach, California and spent a lot of time going to the beach and skateboarding there. I went to high school in Jackson Hole, Wyoming and that helped my skiing skills, and also helped me further connect with nature. </p>
