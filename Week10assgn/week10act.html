           I used the most standard trivia database I could find online that only requires the link to be used. I wanted to make it so it was only video game questions, and it is very easy to do so on this website. My code also allows you to change the link for where the trivia is coming from, and that can change what type of trivia you are getting. I also added a funciton that limits the amount of requests so it does not throw an error since the website has limited requests per second. 

           For my next project this is so useful. I want to make a loading screen for I think Elden Ring that gives the player useful info every time they are loading. This would be fairly simila to what I did today. I now feel confident in pulling data from an API and displaying it on a webpage. This is a very useful skill to have learned, and I am excited to try it with my next project.
